For this assignment, I will provide you with two options. 

The first involves choosing one chapter (basically an article equivalent) from *Maoism at the Grassroots: Everyday Life in China's Era of High Socialism* \[Preview with {{% resource_link "9876b701-e6e4-409d-9903-ab4e8616043e" "Google Books" %}}\]. 

The second is an article "{{% resource_link "f1360202-2136-4703-b466-618c24b6768f" "Missile Science, Population Science: The Origins of China's One Child Policy" %}}." 

I understand you're all busy these days, and we already have plenty of reading so I will make assignment a bit shorter this time. The assignment is graded out of ten points. Make eight to ten annotations either on the article or one chapter in the book of your choosing. After making your annotations (no need for cited annotations—just your thoughts are fine), compose two paragraphs (~3/4 –1 page) double-spaced reflection with 1–2 academic citations (textbook, sourcebook, or Google Books are fine, but try to avoid Wikipedia or "online" media sources). Both readings are really interesting, so I am sure you'll have a lot to say whichever option you choose. 

The ten points will break down as follows:  

- 8–10 annotations (5 points)
- Two paragraph reflection (3 points)
- 1–2 citations in your reflection (2 points)

One thing to keep in mind if you choose the article about family planning is that the article was written in 2005, and the family planning policies of the state have changed since then. Feel free to reflect on those changes in your write-up!

This assignment is due during session 20.
