For your final paper (3–4 double-spaced pages), choose a Chinese (or China-related) film, novel, or work of nonfiction of your choice. Write a report summarizing its key points, its evidence, and your personal reflections.

Feel free to reach out to me for recommendations or questions (or even pdfs/film links). I break down the possibilities as follows so the expectations are clear: 

1. A film. You could choose a historical drama like [*The Soong Sisters*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soong_Sisters_(film)), a Hong Kong comedy like [*Flirting Scholar*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flirting_Scholar), or even a film about China/Hong Kong/Singapore in the 1990s–present. There is "history" in everything, but you'll need to bring it out in your paper. Keep the following questions in mind: When was the film made? What is it about? Is it an accurate depiction of the era it discusses? Why or why not? What did you like or not like about the film (maybe save for the last paragraph)? Note: I am not going to be super picky about the historical accuracy question ("are the costumes exactly correct")—just think in terms of "big picture" and use what you've learned in class. 
2. A novel. You could choose a famous novel from the Republican era, a work of Scar Fiction about the Cultural Revolution, or even a new work of Chinese science fiction like *The* *Three-Body Problem* \[Preview with [Google Books](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Three_Body_Problem/ZrNzAwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1)\]. Keep the following questions in mind: When was the novel written? What is it about? How does it engage history? What did you like or not like about the novel (maybe save for the last paragraph)? Short stories/novellas are okay but remember you need enough content for at least three pages of writing. 
3. A work of nonfiction. You could choose any number of books related to modern China (there are thousands). The same rubric applies for the options above: When was the book written? What's it about? What's its core argument? What evidence does it cite? What did you find compelling or not in its narrative? 

Note: Some of you may prefer to choose a book or film about contemporary China like *How China Escaped the Poverty Trap* \[Preview with [Google Books](https://www.google.com/books/edition/How_China_Escaped_the_Poverty_Trap/_sOdDgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=how+china+escaped+the+poverty+trap&printsec=frontcover)\] or [*Invisible China*](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo61544815.html). That's fine to do as well; the key is applying the skills you learned this semester to the text—being a "historian of now." 

**Grading Rubric (20 points)**

- Introduction to the film, novel, or book: 4 points 
- Discussion of its contents/themes/argument: 4 points
- Evaluation of its historical accuracy, engagement with history, or historical evidence: 3 points 
- At least one paragraph that looks at a specific scene (film), or quotation (book) in detail: 3 points 
- Use of 1–2 sources (textbook or otherwise) to support your claims: 3 points 
- Final reflections on your reaction to or thoughts about the work: 2 points 
- Bibliography or Works Cited: 1 point

This assignment is due during session 25.
