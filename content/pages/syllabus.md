## Course Description

With China playing a central role in global affairs today, an understanding of the country’s history over the last two hundred years has never been more important. In this class, we will trace the collapse of the last imperial dynasty, the political movements of the early twentieth century, the world wars that defined the modern global order, and the country’s monumental rise on the global stage in the early twenty-first century. In addition to examining key documents and archives, we will discuss films, songs, novels, and television programs which convey the triumphs, anxieties, and sorrows of individuals who have confronted a world of constant change for the last century. We will consider issues of power and gender, class, as well as ethnicity from the waning years of the last dynasty through the present. Through this class, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of history, politics, economy, culture, and technology in modern China while engaging in critical interpretations of a wide range of texts and sources that shape contemporary global society.
